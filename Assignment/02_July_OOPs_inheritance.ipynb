    "'''Q1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the\n",
    "\"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the \"superclass\" or \"base\n",
    "class\"). Inheritance enables you to create a new class based on an existing class, incorporating its properties and\n",
    "behaviors while also allowing for extension and specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a \n",
    "base class. Subclasses can then inherit these features without having to redefine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Structure: Inheritance forms a hierarchical relationship between classes, where subclasses are organized\n",
    "under their superclass. This relationship can represent an \"is-a\" or \"kind-of\" relationship between different types of\n",
    "objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Subclasses can extend the functionality of the base class by adding new attributes and methods or overriding\n",
    "existing ones. This allows you to customize the behavior of the subclass while retaining the common features inherited\n",
    "from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance is a foundation for polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as\n",
    "instances of a common superclass. This enables more flexible and dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialization: Subclasses can specialize in specific behaviors or attributes while inheriting general traits from the \n",
    "superclass. This allows you to create more specific and focused classes while maintaining a consistent structure."

    "'''Q2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their\n",
    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance are both concepts in object-oriented programming that relate to how\n",
    "classes inherit attributes and methods from other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one base class. The derived class (subclass) can inherit and extend the\n",
    "attributes and methods of its single parent class. This creates a linear hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance provides a clear and straightforward hierarchy, making the code easier to understand and\n",
    "maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Complexity: Since there's only one parent class, potential conflicts and ambiguities due to multiple inheritance\n",
    "sources are avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one base class. This allows the derived\n",
    "class to combine features from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Multiple inheritance facilitates code reuse by allowing a class to inherit from multiple sources. This can\n",
    "reduce code duplication and promote modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: You can create complex classes by combining the features of multiple parent classes, allowing you to model\n",
    "real-world scenarios more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Parents: The key difference is the number of parent classes a derived class can inherit from. Single inheritance\n",
    "involves one parent class, while multiple inheritance involves two or more parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: Multiple inheritance can lead to the \"diamond problem\" when two or more parent classes have a common base\n",
    "class. This can create confusion and conflicts when methods or attributes from the common base class are overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiple inheritance can introduce greater complexity, potential naming clashes, and the need for careful\n",
    "design to manage conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages vs. Trade-offs: Single inheritance provides simplicity and avoids the diamond problem, but might not offer the\n",
    "same level of flexibility as multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance offers more flexibility and code reuse but can be\n",
    "more complex to manage.\n"

    "'''Q4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does\n",
    "it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In object-oriented programming, access modifiers (also called access specifiers) control the visibility and \n",
    "accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) from outside the class. These modifiers help enforce encapsulation\n",
    "and provide control over how the class's internals are accessed by other classes or code. The three main access modifiers\n",
    "are \"private,\" \"protected,\" and \"public.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how each access modifier works and their significance in the context of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Members marked as private are only accessible within the class that defines them.\n",
    "Private members are not inherited by subclasses.\n",
    "Significance: This is used to hide implementation details and encapsulate sensitive data. Private members are not \n",
    "accessible from outside the class, ensuring data integrity and minimizing external interference.\n",
    "Protected Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Members marked as protected are accessible within the defining class and its subclasses (derived classes).\n",
    "Protected members are inherited by subclasses.\n",
    "Significance: Protected members provide a compromise between encapsulation and inheritance. They allow derived classes to\n",
    "access and extend the behavior of the base class, while still restricting direct access from outside the class hierarchy.\n",
    "This is particularly useful when you want to allow subclasses to modify or build upon the behavior of the base class\n",
    "without exposing everything to external code.\n",
    "Public Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Members marked as public are accessible from any class or code that can access the object.\n",
    "Public members are inherited by subclasses.\n",
    "Significance: Public members provide open access to class attributes and methods. While this allows flexibility, it can \n",
    "also expose internal details and lead to tighter coupling between classes.\n",

    "It allows you to access and invoke methods and attributes of the parent class, enabling you to extend or override the\n",
