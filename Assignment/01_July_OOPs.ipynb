    "'''Q1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and structure software in a way that mirrors \n",
    "the real-world objects and their interactions. OOP focuses on organizing code into modular units called \"objects,\" which\n",
    "encapsulate data (attributes) and the operations (methods) that can be performed on that data. This approach offers \n",
    "several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: Objects allow you to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. \n",
    "These parts can be reused in different parts of your application or even in other projects, leading to more efficient \n",
    "and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit\n",
    "(an object). This helps hide the internal details of an object's implementation from the outside world, allowing for \n",
    "better control of access and reducing potential sources of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes of objects that share common properties\n",
    "and behaviors. This allows you to focus on the essential aspects of an object and ignore unnecessary details, which can \n",
    "lead to clearer and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and \n",
    "behaviors. This promotes code reuse, as you can define a base class with common features and then create specialized \n",
    "classes that add or modify those features as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, \n",
    "providing a way to write more generic and flexible code. This allows you to write functions or methods that can work with\n",
    "various types of objects without needing to know their specific details."

    "'''Q2. What is an object in Python?\n",

    "\n",

    "Attributes can be of various data types, such as integers, strings, lists, and custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the object's attributes. They encapsulate the\n",

    "common to all instances. Instance variables are unique to each instance and are defined within instance methods. They\n",
    "hold data that varies from instance to instance."

    "'''Q6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, the self parameter in class methods refers to the instance of the class that the method is being called on.\n",
    "It allows you to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of that instance. The self parameter is a convention and\n",
    "not a keyword, but it's widely used to refer to the current instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purposes of the self parameter in class methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Instance Variables: Inside a class method, you can use the self parameter to access the instance's attributes\n",
    "(instance variables) and work with their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Methods: Class methods can call other methods of the same instance using the self parameter, allowing for\n",
    "better code organization and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying Instance State: Class methods can modify the state of the instance by updating its attributes."
